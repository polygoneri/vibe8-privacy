Vibe8 Privacy Policy

Last Updated: December 2025

Thank you for using Vibe8.
Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what information our app collects, how it is used, and how it is protected.

1. Information We Collect
Screenshots and Photos You Choose

Vibe8 only analyzes screenshots or images that you explicitly select inside the app.
We do not access your entire photo library, albums, camera, or files.

The app does not automatically upload or analyze anything without your action.

Technical Information

We may collect basic diagnostic information such as:

app performance data

crash logs

basic analytics

This data is non-identifiable and used only to improve the app.

2. How Your Data Is Used

Screenshots you select are temporarily uploaded to our server for the sole purpose of:

performing AI analysis

generating message suggestions

creating context-aware responses

We do not:

sell your data

share your data with advertisers

use your images for training any third-party AI models

store images after processing is complete

Images are deleted automatically after processing unless required for troubleshooting at your request.

3. Third-Party Services

To generate suggestions, Vibe8 uses OpenAI’s API to analyze selected screenshots.

OpenAI processes this data solely to generate the response and does not use it for training unless explicitly allowed (we do not allow this).

4. Your Control and Choices

You can:

choose exactly which screenshots to upload

remove uploaded images at any time

deny photo access permission (the app will simply not function without it)

You may also request deletion of any retained logs by contacting us.

5. Security

We use modern security practices to protect the data you submit, including:

encrypted network communication

HTTPS transport

restricted server access

We strive to protect your data but cannot guarantee absolute security.

6. Contact

If you have questions about this policy or your data, contact us at:
