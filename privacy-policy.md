Vibe8 Privacy Policy
Last Updated: December 2025

1. Introduction
Thank you for using Vibe8. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what information Vibe8 collects, how it is used, and how it is protected.

2. Information We Collect

2.1 Screenshots and Images You Choose
• Vibe8 analyzes only screenshots or images that you explicitly select.
• This applies to both:
  - the main app
  - the Vibe8 custom keyboard extension
• Vibe8 does not automatically scan your photo library, albums, camera, or files.
• No images are accessed or analyzed without a direct user action, such as tapping Generate.

2.2 Keyboard Extension
• The Vibe8 keyboard does not read or monitor your typing in the background.
• When Full Access is enabled, the keyboard may process a screenshot only after you explicitly request suggestion generation.
• If Full Access is disabled, the keyboard does not generate suggestions.

2.3 Technical Information
We may collect limited, non-identifiable technical information, including:
• app performance data
• crash logs
• basic usage analytics

This information is used solely to improve app stability and performance.

3. How Your Data Is Used

Screenshots or images you select are temporarily uploaded for the sole purpose of:
• performing AI analysis
• generating message suggestions
• creating context-aware responses

We do not:
• sell your data
• share your data with advertisers
• use your images for marketing purposes
• store images after processing is complete

Images are deleted automatically after processing unless temporary retention is required for troubleshooting at your request.

4. Third-Party Services

• Vibe8 uses the OpenAI API to analyze selected screenshots and generate suggestions.
• OpenAI processes this data only to generate responses.
• We do not allow the use of submitted data for training third-party AI models.

5. Your Control and Choices

You can:
• choose exactly which screenshots to analyze
• deny photo access permission
• disable Full Access for the keyboard at any time

If photo access or Full Access is disabled, the app and keyboard will not generate suggestions.

You may also request deletion of any retained diagnostic logs by contacting us.

6. Security

We use reasonable security practices to protect your data, including:
• encrypted network communication
• HTTPS transport
• restricted server access

While we take data protection seriously, no system can guarantee absolute security.
