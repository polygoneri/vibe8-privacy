FAQ

How does Vibe8 work?

Vibe8 helps you generate reply suggestions using a smart keyboard.
You take a screenshot of a conversation, tap Generate, and choose a suggested reply.

Does Vibe8 include a keyboard?

Yes. Vibe8 includes a custom keyboard extension.
The keyboard generates suggestions only after you explicitly tap Generate.

Does Vibe8 access my photo library?

Vibe8 only accesses screenshots or images that you explicitly select.
It does not scan your photo library automatically.

The keyboard analyzes only the most recent screenshot after user action.

Does Vibe8 store my images or data?

No. Images are processed only to generate suggestions and are not stored permanently.

Why do I need to enable Full Access for the keyboard?

Full Access is required for the keyboard to communicate with the Vibe8 service and generate AI suggestions.
If Full Access is disabled, the keyboard will show setup instructions instead.

The app or keyboard doesn’t detect my screenshots. What should I do?

Make sure the screenshots clearly show chat bubbles and text.
Blurry, cropped, or incomplete images may affect detection.

I can’t generate suggestions.

Make sure:
• At least one screenshot is selected
• The Vibe8 keyboard is enabled
• Full Access is enabled for the keyboard
