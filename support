FAQ
How does Vibe8 work?

You choose a few recent chat screenshots and Vibe8 generates smart message suggestions tailored to your conversation.

Does Vibe8 access my photo library?

No. Vibe8 only sees the screenshots you manually select. It never scans your library without permission.

Does Vibe8 store my images or data?

No. Your images are processed only to generate suggestions and are not stored.

The app doesn’t detect my screenshots. What should I do?

Make sure the screenshots clearly show chat bubbles and text. Blurry or cropped images may affect detection.

I can’t generate suggestions.

Upload at least one screenshot or selected photo, depending on the mode you’re using.
